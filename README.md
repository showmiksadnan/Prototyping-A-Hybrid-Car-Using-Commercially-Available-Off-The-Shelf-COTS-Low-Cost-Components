# Prototyping-A-Hybrid-Car-Using-Commercially-Available-Off-The-Shelf-COTS-Low-Cost-Components
we have represented a design of a Hybrid car which converts mechanical energy to electrical energy. The hybrid car converts the mechanical energy of the wheel rotations into electrical energy and stores it in a rechargeable battery. When the battery is fully charged, a controller switches from the combustion engine to the battery to power and drive the vehicle. The main objective of this project is to investigate the potential of replacing fossil fuel by renewable energy. Second objective is to develop a hybrid car design using domestically available components thus reducing the cost of manufacturing. A hybrid car presents a very efficient way to reduce the consumption of fuel and it is environmentally friendly. Hybrid vehicles can be categorized as series, parallel and combined architectures. Our system is designed as a series hybrid system. In the 21st century global warming, climate change, increasing price of oil and gas has reached an extreme level. Hybrid car is an innovative and sustainable concept which is very eco-friendly for our environment. It is possible these automobile designs will someday fully replace fossil fuel by renewable energy.
